                Over the past few days, I worked on automating the deployment of a containerized web application by provisioning an AWS EKS cluster using Terraform and deploying Kubernetes manifests with Ansible. Jenkins powered the full CI/CD automation flow, while Docker containerized the React frontend and Django backend. The app now runs in a scalable, managed Kubernetes environment.

              <Typography color="blue-gray" className="mb-4 dark:text-white text-justify">
                Along the way, I tackled challenges related to service exposure and networking, learning key aspects of IAM roles, LoadBalancer configuration, NAT Gateway setup, Route Tables, and more. It was a deeply rewarding experience debugging Fargate pod issues and integrating Jenkins with cloud-native deployments.

                I designed and implemented a robust Jenkins pipeline that automated the entire CI/CD process for a Dockerized application. This project involved containerizing a React-based frontend and a Django backend using Docker, ensuring rapid and secure deployments on AWS EC2.

                The pipeline integrated polling mechanisms for source code changes, proper secret management, and automated testing, making it a comprehensive solution for continuous delivery. This project was a fantastic journey in optimizing the development lifecycle and deployment consistency.
